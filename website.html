    <p class="mental">
      <strong>Mental health</strong> encompasses our emotional, psychological,
      and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, influencing
      our relationships, decision-making, and ability to cope with stress.
      Understanding mental health is crucial because it plays a significant role
      in our daily lives and overall quality of life.

      The Importance of Mental Health
    </h2>
    <p class="mental">
      <strong>Mental health</strong> is as essential as physical health; it
      impacts our ability to lead fulfilling lives. Good mental health enables
      us to manage stress, build relationships, and make meaningful
      contributions to society. Conversely, poor mental health can lead to a
      range of challenges, including difficulties in personal relationships,
      work performance, and overall life satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p class="mental">
      Moreover, mental health conditions are prevalent. According to the
      <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong>, one in four people will
      experience a mental health issue at some point in their lives. Recognizing
      and addressing mental health concerns is vital for fostering a supportive
      community and promoting healthier lifestyles.
